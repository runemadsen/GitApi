# TODO

# When posting a file to a new branch and not specifying from_branch, then commits to that new branch equal 0 and not 1. 
# Use repo.lstree when getting contents of a tree - faster and easier to get recursive contents (if we don't need data in blobs)
# Use File.join for all routes, making sure double // gets caught
# Make all the routes that take :branch work with commit SHA's
# make tests that give wrong params to all the functions
# make the create/update/delete file functions accept array of files
# make api calls that makes tag + tag ref at the same time
# PATCH /repos/:repo - edit repo (only name now)
# POST  /repos/:repo/branches - create branch from another branch
# POST  /repos/:repo/blobs
# GET   /repos/:repo/commits/:sha
# POST  /repos/:repo/commits
# GET   /repos/:repo/refs/:ref
# PATCH /repos/:repo/refs/:ref
# GET   /repos/:repo/tags/:sha
# GET   /repos/:repo/trees/:sha
# POST  /repos/:repo/trees
